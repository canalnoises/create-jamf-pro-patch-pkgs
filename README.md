# Package Jamf Pro
Easily package Jamf Pro applications individually to be used with Jamf Pro's Patch Management.

#### Summary
Patch Management within Jamf Pro requires individual applications when patching the Jamf Pro tools (Jamf Admin, Jamf Remote, Jamf Imaging, Composter, Recon). Creating these indivudual packages can be tedious and sometimes they require special permissions. This script will allow you to package up the installed version of Jamf Pro on a Mac into individual packages with names.
